# SpatialModel

`class SpatialModel`

A in-memory model which has internal spatial representation of the strokes in a canvas. This kind of
spatial representation allows quick manipulations of the content.

### Constructors

| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [&lt;init&gt;](-init-.md) | A in-memory model which has internal spatial representation of the strokes in a canvas. This kind of spatial representation allows quick manipulations of the content.`SpatialModel(strokeFactory: `[`InkStrokeFactory`](../../com.wacom.ink.model/-ink-stroke-factory/index.md)`)` |

### Functions

| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [add](add.md) | Adds an ink stroke to the spatial model.`fun add(stroke: `[`InkStroke`](../../com.wacom.ink.model/-ink-stroke/index.md)`): `[`Unit`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html) |
| [erase](erase.md) | Erase strokes. The erasing may be one of two kinds - whole stroke or partial. The eraser is provided in the form of a spline and the brush with which it is drawn. In the case of the whole stroke erasing - if the eraser passes through a stroke it will be removed. In the case of the partial erasing, the eraser will cut through the the splines, removing some of them and producing new ones.`fun erase(eraser: `[`Spline`](../../com.wacom.ink/-spline/index.md)`, brush: `[`VectorBrush`](../../com.wacom.ink.rendering/-vector-brush/index.md)`, manipulationMode: `[`ManipulationMode`](../-manipulation-mode/index.md)`, callback: `[`ErasingCallback`](../../com.wacom.ink.manipulation.callbacks/-erasing-callback/index.md)`): `[`Unit`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html)<br>Erase strokes. The erasing may be one of two kinds - whole stroke or partial. The eraser is provided in the form of a list of polygons. This method should be used with the result of the ConvexHullChainProducer's add(...) method. In the case of the whole stroke erasing - if the eraser passes through a stroke it will be removed. In the case of the partial erasing, the eraser will cut through the the splines, removing some of them and producing new ones.`fun erase(eraser: `[`ArrayList`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-array-list/index.html)`<`[`DIPointList2D`](../../com.wacom.ink/-d-i-point-list2-d.md)`>, manipulationMode: `[`ManipulationMode`](../-manipulation-mode/index.md)`, callback: `[`ErasingCallback`](../../com.wacom.ink.manipulation.callbacks/-erasing-callback/index.md)`): `[`Unit`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html) |
| [get](get.md) | Get a stroke from the spatial model.`fun get(id: `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)`): `[`InkStroke`](../../com.wacom.ink.model/-ink-stroke/index.md)`?` |
| [getStrokes](get-strokes.md) | Get all the strokes that are currently available in the model.`fun getStrokes(): `[`HashMap`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-hash-map/index.html)`<`[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)`, `[`InkStroke`](../../com.wacom.ink.model/-ink-stroke/index.md)`>`<br>Get all stroke in a given rect.`fun getStrokes(rect: `[`Rect`](../../com.wacom.ink.math/-rect/index.md)`): `[`ArrayList`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-array-list/index.html)`<`[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)`>` |
| [remove](remove.md) | Delete a stroke from the spatial model.`fun remove(id: `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)`): `[`Boolean`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-boolean/index.html) |
| [reset](reset.md) | Reset the Spatial Model, erasing all of its content.`fun reset(): `[`Unit`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html) |
| [select](select.md) | Select strokes. The selecting may be one of two kinds - whole stroke or partial. In both cases a closed polygon is produced from the selector spline. In the case of the whole stroke selecting - if the selector polygon intersects a stroke it will be selected. In the case of the partial selecting - the selector polygon will cut the splines, removing the old ones, producing new and selecting those inside the selector.`fun select(selector: `[`Spline`](../../com.wacom.ink/-spline/index.md)`, manipulationMode: `[`ManipulationMode`](../-manipulation-mode/index.md)`, callback: `[`SelectingCallback`](../../com.wacom.ink.manipulation.callbacks/-selecting-callback/index.md)`): `[`Unit`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html)<br>Select strokes. The selecting may be one of two kinds - whole stroke or partial. In the case of the whole stroke selecting - if the selector polygon intersects a stroke it will be selected. In the case of the partial selecting - the selector polygon will cut the splines, removing the old ones, producing new and selecting those inside the selector.`fun select(selector: `[`DIPolygon`](../../com.wacom.ink/-d-i-polygon.md)`, manipulationMode: `[`ManipulationMode`](../-manipulation-mode/index.md)`, callback: `[`SelectingCallback`](../../com.wacom.ink.manipulation.callbacks/-selecting-callback/index.md)`): `[`Unit`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html) |
